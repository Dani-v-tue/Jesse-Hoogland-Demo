# Jesse-Hoogland-Demo

Most of my code projects have been either too private and looking back low quality, or done under an NDA.  

This is the reason I created this repository, to share some small projects I have written recently.  

Important to note is that my primary language: Python is not represented here, as I am trying to broaden my horizons in my free-time.
